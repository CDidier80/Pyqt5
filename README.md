# Pyqt5
Here are two python file. One contains the Ui_MainWindow class and another contains Ui_Dialog class. So, here when I clicked the button of the mainWindow, it opens the dialog box.
So, user gives some input in the lineEdit of the dialog box and then clicked ok button. When the user clicked the ok button the dialog box close.

I want to get the value of the lineEdit value of the dialog box when click the ok button. And also I want to update the label of the mainWindow by that lineEdit value.
